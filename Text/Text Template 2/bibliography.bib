Using a spatial regression discontinuity design, we show that developers respond to the reform with short-run increases in filings for multi-family construction permits in blocks with higher allowable densities. In the medium-run we observe increases in housing availability and reductions in house prices in neighborhoods that were allowed more densification. Welfare is then estimated with an equilibrium model of housing demand and supply that allows for endogeneous housing regulation. We finding that, in the long-run, the reform produces a 1.9\% increase in housing stock and a 0.5\% reduction in prices, with substantial heterogeneity across neighborhoods. Consumer welfare gains due to price reductions are small, but increase 4-fold once accounting for changes in built environment, with more gains accruing to college educated and higher income families. However, nominal house price losses faced by landlords and existing homeowners overshadow all consumer welfare gains.},

Using insurance data sets, this practical, rigorous book treats GLMs, covers all standard exponential family distributions, extends the methodology to correlated data structures, and discusses recent developments which go beyond the GLM. The issues in the book are specific to insurance data, such as model selection in the presence of large data sets and the handling of varying exposure times. Exercises and data-based practicals help readers to consolidate their skills, with solutions and data sets given on the companion website. Although the book is package-independent, SAS code and output examples feature in an appendix and on the website. In addition, R code and output for all the examples are provided on the website.},

In this paper, we examine the increasing number of land-use regulations in Greater Boston. These regulations vary widely over space, and are hard to predict with any variables other than historical density levels. Minimum lot size and other land use controls are associated with reductions in new construction activity. These regulations are associated with higher prices when we do not control for contemporary density and demographics, but not when we add these contemporaneous controls. These results are compatible with economic theory, which predicts that production restraints on a good won't increase the price of that good relative to sufficiently close substitutes. Current density levels appear to be too low to maximize local land values.},

Available estimates of delay cost are identified, but are shown to be deficient even as measures of the private cost of delay. Various suggestions are made for the improvement of existing approaches, but it is concluded that the assessment of private and social delay costs requires case-study research which distinguishes between property sectors, locations and different points in the cycle of property development.},

  abstract = {Problem, research strategy, and findings Income segregation has risen in each of the last four decades in U.S. metropolitan areas, which can have lifelong impacts on the health, economic productivity, and behaviors of residents. Although it is widely assumed that local land use regulations---such as minimum lot sizes and growth controls---exclude low-income households from wealthier neighborhoods, the empirical research is surprisingly limited. We examine the relationship between land use regulation and segregation by income using new measures for the 95 biggest cities in the United States. We find that density restrictions are associated with the segregation of the wealthy and middle income, but not the poor. We also find that more local pressure to regulate land use is linked to higher rates of income segregation, but that more state control is connected to lower-income segregation. Takeaway for practice Density restrictions do drive urban income segregation of the rich, not the poor, but should be addressed because rich enclaves create significant metropolitan problems. Planners at the local level need assistance from regional and state efforts to ameliorate income segregation. Inclusionary housing requirements have a greater potential to reduce income segregation than bringing higher-income households into lower-income parts of the city. Finally, comprehensive and consistent data on the impacts of local land use regulations should be collected to inform future research and planning practice.},

  abstract = {Regulatory efforts to reduce public hazards could be undermined when agents respond strategically to enforcement. This paper quantifies changes in road safety from a national safety inspection regulation for commercial vehicles over the past two decades, analyzes the causes of those changes, and suggests ways to improve the regulatory design to enhance public safety. I compile a comprehensive database on inspections and accidents involving all trucks inspected nationwide from 1996 to 2018. I implement an event study that tracks a given truck's accident rate shortly before and after inspection. There is a sharp, 44.6\% increase in the accident rate immediately following an inspection; the effect lasts for at least 14 days. Further analysis points to an explanation consistent with the Becker model: because inspectors rarely conduct repeat inspections of recently checked trucks, the drivers of these trucks then drive more recklessly, leading to more accidents following an inspection. The drivers' compensating behaviors lead to an estimated 1,803 additional accidents per year, costing roughly \$1.6 billion. A comparison of different regulatory designs across states shows that alternative policy designs that randomize inspection practices and schedules could reduce accident rates.},

We further suggest that growth revolts themselves provide a useful window into discretionary approvals, and illustrate how discretion can create conflict. Discretion is appealing to fiscally constrained cities because it lets them bargain with developers over building permissions, and thus helps cities finance public amenities. But it also gives cities incentives to regulate more heavily than they otherwise might, and to regulate pretextually: to write rules primarily for the purpose of bargaining them away. In sum, zoning's increasing use as a tool of fiscal policy can undermine its traditional role of providing assurance about future land use policy. We use various examples to illustrate our argument, including five growth revolts in Southern California.},

  abstract = {There is emerging evidence that restrictive land use practices can misallocate economic activity across space and generate significant costs for regional and national economies. Work in this area has considered how land use regulations affect the supply of housing within, and the efficient migration of workers among, regions. According to some estimates, by restricting migration to the most productive regions in the United States, land use regulations generate an annual cost to the economy of up to US\$1.95 trillion or 13.6 percent of gross domestic product. Yet this focus on labor migration provides an insufficient framework for understanding how land use regulations can shape economic performance. First, current approaches minimize the costs that could arise if firms and industries are misallocated across space. Second, current work overlooks the costs that might arise if land use restrictions misallocate economic activity within regions. Land use regulations can generate significant costs when their administration is designed to maximize the welfare of individual communities rather than the economies of regions and nations. This article will evaluate current research into, and provide a more complete assessment of, the welfare costs associated with restrictive land use practices.},

The model accounts for 40\% of the observed differences in regulation across cities. Quantitative experiments show that excessive local regulation reduces aggregate productivity, but not necessarily welfare because, unlike renters, landowners benefit from regulation. I propose federal policies that raise productivity and welfare by weakening incentives to regulate land use.},

Using this decomposition, we arrive at a novel strategy for estimating a plausibly causal effect of land use regulation on land value and welfare. This strategy exploits cross-border changes in development, prices, and regulation in regions near municipal borders. Our estimates suggest large negative effects of regulation on the value of land and welfare in these regions.},
