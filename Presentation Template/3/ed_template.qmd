## Research Question

-   What is the effect of truck parking accidents on truck stop creation?
-   To what extent is the role of zoning in truck stop creation?

## Motivation

-   Parking shortage for trucks –\> Leads to accidents
-   increases costs
-   reduces public safety
-   delayed goods
-   80% of goods are delivered by truck (BTS)

## Background

-   truck parking infrastructure has not kept pace with industry growth.

-   The shortage of legal parking -\> illegal parking/ unsafe driving **-\>** increasing the risk of accidents.

## **Scale of the Problem**

-   3.874 million truck drivers in North America (U.S. and Canada).

-   average of 56 minutes per day searching for parking.

-   This results in a \$5,600 annual economic loss per driver.

-   this translates to a **\$21.69** billion annual loss.

-   70%-98% of truck drivers face parking challenges, making the problem even larger (ATRI, USDOT).

## **Comparison**

-   Using conservative estimates (43.8% of truckers struggle to find parking)

-   **1.53 million** affected drivers nearly twice the total homeless population in North America **(\~865,000)**.

## **Zoning as a Critical Barrier**

-   Despite widespread acknowledgment of the truck parking shortage, **zoning laws hinder the development of parking facilities**.

-   Many cities oppose new truck stops due to land value concerns and public resistance.

-   **90,056 local governments in the U.S.** enforce unique zoning restrictions, making a nationwide solution difficult.

## Contribution

-   There is limited empirical research quantifying how zoning regulations influence truck parking availability.

-   New phenomena

-   Analyze the relationship between zoning laws, truck stop creation, and parking shortages by using traffic accident data.

-   Unique insight, new data, recent phenomena

## Institutional Setting

-   USA

-   1993-2016

## Data

-   USDOT’s FMCSA Crash File, all reported vehicle crashes in the U.S. (1990–Present), \~1993–2016.

-   Detailed accident information: vehicle types (trucks, motorcycles, buses), accident circumstances (e.g., involvement of parked vehicles), result (fatalities).

-   Zoning classifications from @puentesTraditionalReformedReview2006 , \~ four types: Traditional, Exclusion, Reform, and Wild Wild Texas.

-   Data set on truck stop directory (Yang, 2024)

## Truct Stop Creation Data

observe change in truck stop creation at (2007, 2008 , 2015 2016)

## Strategy

\
Insufficient Truck Parking → Illegal Truck Parking/Unsafe Driving → **Observed Accidents** → Increased Demand for Truck Parking → **Increase in Truck Stops.**

## **Event Study Model Overview**

$$ \Delta \text{NumTruckStop}_{j,t=[2006-2016]} =  \sum_{i=1993}^{2006} \text{Fatality}_{j,i} +  \\ \gamma_{j}+ \lambda_{t}+ \mu_{l} +  \epsilon $$

year $t$ , time $t$, zoning category $j$, location $l$ (fix effects)

-   $\Delta\text{NumTruckStop}_{t}$ —- change in truck stop

-   $\text{Fatality}_{i}$ -– Indicator variable for fatalities $>1$ and in year $i$

## Results

## Interpretation

-   A traffic accident 4 years prior results to 2.7 truck stop increase relative to 2006
-   5 years to build a truck stop

## Results

## Zoning Fixed Effects (coefficients)

## Zoning Fixed Effects Interpretation

Noisy result. exclusion has low observation count

## Limitation

Cant Observe Pretends

# DID

## DID

$$
\Delta \text{NumTruckStop}_{j,t} = \sum_{i \in \{2007, 2008, 2015, 2016\}} \text{Accident}_{j,t=i} + \gamma_j + \\\lambda_t + \mu_l + \epsilon
$$

year $t$ , time $i$, zoning category $j$, location $l$ (fix effects)

-   $\Delta \text{NumTruckStop}_{j,t}$ , change in number of truck stops
-   $\text{Accident}_{j,t}$ is a dummy variable indicating whether a high fatality accident and occurred between $2008$ and $2015$

## Observe Fix Effect

We see the same thing. Noisy observation

## Location Matters More

Nice clean separation

## Bias

-   Measurement Error: truck stop vs truck capacity \~ underestimate

-   Anticipation Effect: policies other than truck stops (change in parking ordinances) may be implemented to ease the infrastructure shortage \~ underestimate

-   Zoning classifications may change @mclaughlinLandUseRegulation2012 \~ underestimate

-   Timing of the treatment (2008, 2015) (time FE)

## Policy Implication and Conclusion

-   Municipalities are self regulating adequately with response to trucking accidents.

-   One-size-fits-all federal approach is not needed.

-   Some outlier municipalities may require targeted policy interventions.
