# Updates

1.  Background

2.  Paper Recommendation ([Yuanning Liang](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=3113619 "View other papers by this author"),2021)

3.  Current Results of Event Study Model

4.  Next Steps (4 Zoning Types)

# Background

## Background

-   90,056 local governments

-   Inadequate truck parking has led to dangerous or illegal practices (such as **parking on highway shoulders** or in unauthorized areas, which heightens traffic accident risks and imposes economic costs like increased fuel consumption, delivery delays, and inflated goods prices)

-   limited empirical research

-   traffic accident data as a proxy for truck parking demand -\> land-use regulations -\> truck parking availability.

## Zoning regulation welfare-enhancing?

No Truck Parking → Trucks will illegally park → **Accidents Occur** (observed)→Truck Parking Demand increases → **Truck Parking Capacity Increase** (observed)

## 4 Zoning Categories

## Data

## Event Study Model

$$
\Delta \text{NumTruckStop}_{tj} = \sum_{i=-n}^{n} \beta_{ij} \text{Accident}_{ij}\cdot \text{Severity}_{ij} \\ + \gamma_{tj} X_{tj} + \epsilon_{tj}
$$

year $t$ ,category $j$, time $i$

-   $\Delta\text{NumTruckStop}_{tj}$ —- change in truck stop

-   $\text{Accident}_{i,j}$ –- event dummy indicating the presence of a Accident

-   $\text{Severity}_{ij}$ -– fatalities/injuries/vehicle associated

## Adjusted Event Model

$$
\Delta \text{NumTruckStop}_{j,t=2006-2016} = \\\sum_{i=-2}^{0} \beta_{j,t+i} \text{Accident}_{j,t+i}\cdot \text{Severity}_{j,t+i} + \gamma_{tj} X_{tj} + \epsilon_{tj}
$$

-   year $t$ ,category $j$, time $i$

-   $\Delta\text{NumTruckStop}_{tj}$ —- change in truck stop

-   $\text{Accident}_{i,j}$ –- event dummy: presence of a Accident

-   $\text{Severity}_{ij}$ -– fatalities/injuries/vehicle associated

## **([Yuanning Liang](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=3113619 "View other papers by this author"),2021)**

-   Useful and highly relevant data description

# Adjusted Even Study Model Results

## Fatalities Model

we see its mostly noise

![](images/12.png)

## No truck stop creation is related to higher accidents

high accidents -\> less than 1 truck stop made

![](images/13-01.png)

## Injuries Model

mostly noise

![](images/injuries.png)

## Vehicle Model

Conditioning on places with a high truck stop creation. high accidents -\> less truck stop creation

![](images/vehicle_accidents.png)

## Conclusion and Next Steps

-   We found evidence supporting that places with high truck stops creation don't/negatively responds to accidents. This supports the idea that places do not respond to the need for truck stops.

-   We will start categorizing zoning areas into the 4 types of zoning

# Next Steps: 4 Categories

## 4 Categories (Map)

## 4 Categories (Summary Statistics)

## 4 Categories (Properties)

![](images/Screenshot%202025-02-03%20171307.png)

## 4 Categories

Places exhibit properties we expect and are Stable and Consistent

## Data Encoding (work in progress)

Zoning types will be incorporated into event study model

## How to Efficiently Fill uncategorized data?

-   Our current data set is richer than zoning categories data set.

-   What method is best to categorized uncategorized data?

-   How do we efficiently find nearest neighbor to match neighboring category?

## DiD Model (work in progress)

$$
Y_{tj} = \sum_{t=-n}^{n} \theta_{tj} HR_{tj} + \sum_{t=-n}^{n} \phi_{tj} Post_{tj} + \sum_{t=-n}^{n} \psi_{tj} (HR_{tj} \times Post_{tj}) \\+ \gamma_{tj} X_{tj} + \epsilon_{tj}
$$

-   category $j$ , time $i$

-   $Y_{tj}$ —- change in truck parking capacity

-   $HR_{tj}$ —- high restriction index

-   $Post_{tj}$ —- represents the indicator for the post-accident period
