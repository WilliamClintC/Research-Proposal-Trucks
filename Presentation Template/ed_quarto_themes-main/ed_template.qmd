1.  Background

2.  **([Yuanning Liang](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=3113619 "View other papers by this author"),2021)**

## Background

-   90,056 local governments

-   Inadequate truck parking has led to dangerous or illegal practices (such as **parking on highway shoulders** or in unauthorized areas, which heightens traffic accident risks and imposes economic costs like increased fuel consumption, delivery delays, and inflated goods prices)

-   limited empirical research

-   traffic accident data as a proxy for truck parking demand -\> land-use regulations -\> truck parking availability.

## Zoning regulation welfare-enhancing?

No Truck Parking → Trucks will illegally park → **Accidents Occur** (observed)→Truck Parking Demand increases → **Truck Parking Capacity Increase** (observed)

## 4 Zoning Categories

## Event Study Model

$$
\Delta \text{NumTruckStop}_{tj} = \sum_{i=-n}^{n} \beta_{ij} \text{Accident}_{ij}\cdot \text{Severity}_{ij} + \gamma_{tj} X_{tj} \\ + \epsilon_{tj}
$$

-   year $t$ ,category $j$, time $i$

-   $\Delta\text{NumTruckStop}_{tj}$ —- change in truck stop

-   $\text{Accident}_{i,j}$ –- event dummy indicating the presence of a Accident

-   $\text{Severity}_{ij}$ -– fatalities associated with the accident

## DiD Model (work in progress)

$$
Y_{tj} = \sum_{t=-n}^{n} \theta_{tj} HR_{tj} + \sum_{t=-n}^{n} \phi_{tj} Post_{tj} + \sum_{t=-n}^{n} \psi_{tj} (HR_{tj} \times Post_{tj}) \\+ \gamma_{tj} X_{tj} + \epsilon_{tj}
$$

-   category $j$ , time $i$

-   $Y_{tj}$ —- change in truck parking capacity

-   $HR_{tj}$ —- high restriction index

-   $Post_{tj}$ —- represents the indicator for the post-accident period
